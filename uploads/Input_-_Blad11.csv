1033,100-01,"A timeless classic that never goes out of style, this solid-coloured silk tie is just as good for parties as it is for work. The tie is handmade from 100% silk and is woven with a subtle striped texture for a luxurious feel. As the tie is developed and designed in Sweden, all details have been carefully considered to create the perfect tie. The inner material is made of a wool blend to give the tie a neat knot and straight fall. The material breathes well, making it comfortable to wear around the neck. The back of the tie is made of silk fabric, which is called self-tipping. Reinforced seams in exposed areas to ensure high durability."
